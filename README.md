## dev tasklist
- update the studio list view with the multilistview
	- so you can change the status of the studio at the same time
		- create a button to say "Contacted now"
- check if when sending a mail I change the "last contacted date" in studio date
- update the copilot setting
	- list of copilot prompt presets
- create the mail watcher tool? (using thread)
- create a studio banlist (to dodge from selection) --> maybe using a tag
- invert the contact selection (everything if not tagged)
- change studiolist update with the extend method?
